            <p>Founded in 2023, Rafba Soft began its journey with a simple vision — to empower businesses through smart, custom-built software solutions. Starting with ERP systems developed in Oracle, we quickly gained recognition for crafting high-performance, business-specific applications that simplify operations and drive growth.

                As the business landscape evolved, so did we. Today, Rafba Soft proudly offers end-to-end Odoo ERP solutions alongside fully customized software tailored to the unique needs of industries like retail, fitness, textiles, petroleum, and healthcare.
